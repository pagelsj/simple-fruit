# Simple Fruit

The Simple Fruit Website was built using the Angular framework using a very simple UI styling 'framework' that built on top of the Bootstrap Grid Framework.

I also gave myself an 1.5hr window to complete the task. However, this has taken longer than the allocated window and has taken 3hrs so far.

## Building and deploying

### Install and deploy steps

 1. Clone the repository using git-cli.

    `git clone git@github.com:pagelsj/simple-fruit.git`
2. Install all the needed packages using npm, or yarn.

    `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. The project and all dependencies will now be installed and ready to run.

    `ng serve`

## Assumptions
The website needed to be:
1. Maintainable
2. Make use of re-usable code
3. Extendable
4. Follow the Angular Style-guide

## Improvements
1. I would have liked to add unit tests!
2. The original aim was to add NGSX to the project to manage the storage and manipulate data.
